    <h2> ~ ABOUT ME ~ </h2>
    <p>
      
      I'm a Telematic Engineering student in her "third year", haha if you know, you know. A regular girlie that has a strong passion for sports, music, and reading, and I am deeply committed to personal development and lifelong learning. Through this vlog, I aim to share valuable insights and experiences related to growth, self-discipline, and creativity, while also exploring new knowledge and innovative ideas.
Whether youâ€™re here for inspiration, motivation, or simply to learn something new, Iâ€™m glad to have you on this journey with me. You're safe here, have fun.

  <section id="intro">
    <h2> ~ INTRO ~ </h2>
    <p>In this space, I share the different projects Iâ€™m working on across several key areas of my life. As a Telematics Engineering student, I want to get involved in academic and technical projects, aiming to strengthen my skills and expand my knowledge.
I also explore topics related to personal finance, focusing on how to manage your money wisely in your 20s, build smart habits, and start investing early.
In addition, Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning, so I regularly dive into new topicsâ€”whether itâ€™s through online courses, books, or hands-on experiences.
Lastly, I believe in a balanced lifestyle, which is why I also include healthy habits, fitness tips, and insights on how to build a strong body and mind while staying focused on your goals.
This is a space for growth, knowledge, and self-improvementâ€”one step at a time. I also want to say this page was also a project cause I created it from zero, even tho I'm still learning, it looks great right? </p>
