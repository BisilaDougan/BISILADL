  <h2> Telematic Engineering </h2>
    <p>¿what is Telematic Engineering?  </p>
    <p> When I tell people I study Telematic Engineering I mostly everytime get the "what does a telematic engineeer do?" or "what is that for, it souds heavy". Well here, I'll explain everithing I know and learning and clear doubts, regarding TI in a very simple way,with real life examples son you know what the heck this degree is about (and how cool it is sometimes)</p>
    <p>Think of it as if -Mr. Computer Science (programiing, servers, operating systems) and -Mrs. Telecoomunications(networks, data, how info travels) had a child, who they decided to call Telematic Engineering, (wich persanality is based on makin sure that data moves safely,quickly, and smartly fro one place to another)</p>
    <p>For example, when you send a voice note on whatsapp, the audio doesn't teleport through the air or it magically flies to the person receiving it,there's a protocol, a network route, and data packs making sure the messagge gets from your phone to your friend's. That's Telematics when he's grown up and started working. The same as when you're on a video call at the gym, you're camera, internet,mic... all working toghether in real time, thanks to protocols design to avoid frozen screens and poor comunication</p>
    <p>So, in this degree, the internet works behind the scenes,to build and manage network systems, to make comunication between devices smooth, secure and fast, to program software that interacts with the real world to make your digital life actually work.</p>
    <p>Most Telematics Eng. degrees last 4 years(in a world where money rains from the sky), joking, but the 90% percent of people doing engineering in general last longer,cause doing that shi is not for the week,on those "4" years you have optional interships and final projects, after that you can continue with a masters degree (that's usaually 1-2 years) if you want to speacialize in cybersecurity, networking, 5G,AI etc., that's basically life nowadays, reason why you will always or mostly always have a job.</p>
    <p> Now let's get into the less cool part.Yes! it's challenging, yes you could cry somedays, yes you maybe could think of quitting, yes you could fail examns tremendously even if you studied, yes , yes, yes buuuuuut!,I personally think nothing in this life is quite easy so you have to choose your type of pain and learn from that and deal with it and finish with it, and most important the pain that's assuring you good money, and a very wealthy and comfortable lifetyle, make the pain worth it bro/sis.But listeing it maybe not be as difficult as it is for me or for Pedro, it depends on how dsiciplined nd consistent you are, its not about being a geniius just being very selfaware it requieres  lot of hours and cosnsitency, also good organization of your time, the content your studying, practice, sleep, and have mental strength, so my adive to everyones thinking weather to do ir not will be:</p>
    <p> - Don't be too calm and leave things for the last moment it's better to have things on track, don't be like me in my first years</p>
    <p> - Be selfaware it requires a lot hours and practice, organize your time, your lectures, and have a comfortable study method adapted for you </p>
    <p> -Be consistent, or try, learn self-discipline cause that's something is going to show not just in your studies but in every area of your life, and and practice daily or almost</p>
    <p> -Its okay to fail, you don't get upset you learn from that and come even stronger, failing sometimes its part of the process of learning</p>
    <p> -Be curious about technology, be curious, ask questions build small projects on your own or with groups of people</p>
    <p> -Go to Tutorias! everytime you’re stuck or in doubt go to meeting with your teacher, ask him questions, or to classmates</p>
    <p> -Romantize it, make it look fun, and cool, and interesting cause it is, find a way to enjoy while you study something new about it.</p>
    <P> Lastly, don't compare you're process with no one's, focus on your own path, your journey, you might feel lost or behind sometimes but it's part of the process, you're growing and learning to be at that point of your life cause you never been there before, my kind and patient with yourself, it takes time, Rome wasn't build in a day, maybe you're bright future is going to take more years, but more years of continiouos learning.</P>





<section id="FINANCES">

  <h2> How to manage your finances </h2>
  <p> Being financially stable in your 20's, mission imposible?</p>
  <P> Let's be honest managing money in your 20s is wild, one minute you're making a budget, the next minute is "money comes and goes".With bills, rent, food, unexpected expenses, and the presure to "enjoy your youth".It's easy to feel like saving or being financially stable is something reserved for people with high salaries, but the truth is: </p>
  <p>  It's not imposible - it's just not easy. And it's perfectly fine to have struggles with it.</p>
  <P> Most of us were never taught how to budget,save or invest. Managing your finances doesn't mean giving up your freedom- it means choosing your freedom and weren't taught that financial freedom isn't about how much you make either, but how intentionally you use what you have. And that mindset shift bro, i tell you it changes everything </P>
  <p> -"I don't earn much, how can I save?. Start small, Even 10 euros set aside each week is a win. it's not about the amount, is about the habit.</p>
  <P> -"I don't know where to start". Love start by tracking where your money goes. Awareness is the first step to change</P>
  <p> Your 20s are the perfect time to build selfawareness, not just emotionally, but financially too. Learning how to manage your money isn't about being boring or restrictive, it's about creating a life that supports your dreams, not your debts.</p>
  <p> You don't need to be perfect,You just need to be corious, conscious, nd consistent.You are allowed to enjoy your 20s and plan wisely. You can still go out, treat yourself,and travel- with balance</p>
  <P> This blog isn't about shaming you for what you haven't done, cause we listen we don't judge. It's about encouraging you to take small, powerful steps towards the version of yourself who feels safe, supported, and strong with the money you have. Cause finncial wellness is self-love and we love us some self-love acts here.</P>
  <p> The mindset we are hving here is that: - Saving money isnt't about being boring, it's about building freedom for your future baddas self, periooood.</p>
  <P> Let's talk now about financial plans. First we have:</P>
  <P> -The 50/30/20 Rule.</P>
  <p> Let's say we have three carts. Like one for "Needs", one for the "Wants", and one for the "Goals". Okay so lets say we earn 1000e monthly, so you're gonna split it like this:</p>
  <p> ·500 --- Needs (rent, bills, groceries, transport)</p>
  <p> ·300 --- Wants (shoping, gym, going out, netflix, spotify)</p>
  <p> ·200 --- Goals (savings, emergency funds, investing)</p>
  <p> Next we have : </p>

<h2> did you know...? <h2>
<p> Looking at bright screens right before bed, reduces your melatonin production( the sleep hormone) and can make you to take up to 40 minutes longer to fall asleep. This has turned a habit in our society nowadays, especially the youth, cause we unfortunatelly are a phone addicted generation, we use our phones for almost everything now, and that is in some affecting areas of our lives, we normally need 7-8 hours of sleep daily and, its very important cause that's one of our main sources of energy and recovering, and we are used to using our phone at night, scrolling, or chatting, I would recommend to turn on warm light mode, or put your phone away 30 minutes before sleeping, and also dedicating yourselve some time to do what ever you want on social media, in the evening, so that you at night give yourselve the time you deserve to  sleep   </p>
